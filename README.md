What is a hackathon?
--------------------
> "The word "hackathon" is a portmanteau of the words "hack" and "marathon",
> where "hack" is used in the sense of playful, exploratory programming, not its
> alternate meaning as a reference to computer crime." A hackathon is a time and
> a place for you to make something. Doesn’t matter if it’s a web app, a mobile
> app, a desktop app, or something in between.

Where can I find hackathons?
----------------------------
There are many hackathons running every weekend, but unfortunately they are not
all in one place. For students in universities in the United States,
[Major League Hacking (MLH)][mlh] provides information on hackathons based on
where they fall within university semesters. In order to attend a MLH-sponsered
hackathon, you must be a student who is either attending a university, or
sometimes a student in a secondary school such as a high school.

For those looking for hackathons outside of the United States, or hackathons
that are not directly associated with universities,
[Hacker League][hacker-league] also sponsors hackathons hosted in both the
United States and internationally. Hacker Leauge also provides information on
hackathons hosted during the summer and hackathons not directly associated with
a university, but instead associated with an external company or cause.

The day before
==============

The day before the hackathon, you should make sure that you have done the following.

1. Create an account on ChallengePost
2. Print a few copies of your resume
3. Pack your bag

In preparation for a hackathon, you should attendees create an account on
[ChallengePost](challengepost.com). ChallengePost is where MLH tells hackathons
to handle submissions and many hosts will handle their judging through this site.

What should I pack?
-------------------
- Laptop, *Most hackathon hosts will have some extra laptops available if you don't have one.*
- Chargers for your laptop and mobile devices
- Ethernet cable - Wireless access points may become unavailable due the the number of people connecting to them. Be sure to bring an ethernet cable to connect to the internet with.
- Big backpack - You will be accumulating lots of swag throught the competition. You will want a place to store it for the trip home.
- Hygiene items (toothbrush, toothpase, deodorant, etc.)
- A comfortable hoodie
- A pocket folder with about 10 to 20 copies of your resume.

Many of the sponsors who go to hackathons are actively recruiting new employees
or interns. A hackathon can be a great way to get an internship with a company
or get a job and start your career.
