What is a hackathon?
--------------------
> "The word "hackathon" is a portmanteau of the words "hack" and "marathon",
> where "hack" is used in the sense of playful, exploratory programming, not its
> alternate meaning as a reference to computer crime." A hackathon is a time and
> a place for you to make something. Doesn’t matter if it’s a web app, a mobile
> app, a desktop app, or something in between.

Where can I find hackathons?
----------------------------
There are many hackathons running every weekend, but unfortunately they are not
all in one place. For students in universities in the United States,
[Major League Hacking (MLH)][mlh] provides information on hackathons based on
where they fall within university semesters. In order to attend a MLH-sponsered
hackathon, you must be a student who is either attending a university, or
sometimes a student in a secondary school such as a high school.

For those looking for hackathons outside of the United States, or hackathons
that are not directly associated with universities,
[Hacker League][hacker-league] also sponsors hackathons hosted in both the
United States and internationally. Hacker Leauge also provides information on
hackathons hosted during the summer and hackathons not directly associated with
a university, but instead associated with an external company or cause.
